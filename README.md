WhatsApp LLM Fine-Tuning Project
This project fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) for WhatsApp-style conversational tasks using the Unsloth library and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques. It leverages efficient 4-bit quantized models to optimize memory usage and performance.

🚀 Features
Fine-tunes a quantized transformer model using Unsloth and LoRA.

Supports efficient 4-bit model loading to reduce memory usage.

Flexible configuration for different hardware (e.g., Float16, Bfloat16).

Ready for conversational AI or chat assistant tasks like WhatsApp replies.

📦 Dependencies
The notebook installs the following Python packages:

unsloth (via GitHub)

xformers

trl, peft, accelerate, bitsandbytes

You can install them manually with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir --no-deps git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git
pip install xformers trl peft accelerate bitsandbytes
🧠 Model Setup
The project uses:

Base model: unsloth/mistral-7b-bnb-4bit

PEFT method: LoRA adapters for efficient fine-tuning

🛠️ Configuration
Key parameters include:

max_seq_length = 1024

load_in_4bit = True

lora_alpha = 16

r = 16 (LoRA rank)

These can be tuned based on the target application or hardware limitations.

📝 Usage
Run the whatsapp_llm.ipynb notebook step by step to:

Install necessary packages.

Load the base model.

Apply LoRA adapters.

(Optional) Further customize or train on your dataset.
